# Project2
Welcome to Siamese Exercise App the greatest exercise app ever made. In this app you will be able to track your exercise you do throughout the day. You will just need to set up an account using your email. One you are all set up you are able to choose what exercise you performed that day and it will show you how many calories you have burned during that exercise. There will also be a way to set a daily or weekly goal for yourself, just set the amount of calories you would like to burn and you will see a progress bar showing how close you are to completing your goal. You will also be able to compete against other users to see who are burn the most calories on a daily or weekly basis.
